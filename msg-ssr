Hello Ujjawal ji,thank you for taking our fight forward. 
I live in the US and I feel gutted with what's happening in my India, my Mumbai.

I wasn't a hardcore SSR fan, but I heart cries out loud after learning with SSR went through. 

I hope GOD gives strength to his family and his close ones.

I follow each and every video that you post. Considering how boldly and fearlessly you are taking our fight forward, I must say I am concerned about your safety as well from the mafia involved. Sir, please do take good care of yourself.

I have a suggestion (probable a tough one). Could you please try and get hold of the locksmith that SSR's flatmates and domestic helpers claimed to have called to open SSR's bedroom door.

I hope our HERO Sushant Singh Rajput gets Justice.
